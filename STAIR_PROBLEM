/************************************************************************************
 ****************************** STAIR PROBLEM ***************************************
 * You are an avid stair climber.  To make it more interesting, you sometimes
 * take 1 step, you sometimes jump 2 steps, and you sometimes jump 3 steps.
 *
 * You want to determine how many possible ways you can climb any size stair
 * case with any number of steps. Since you are a programmer, you decide to
 * code up an algorithm to figure this out for you.
 *
 * Examples:
 *  There are 7 possible ways to climb up a 4 step stair case
 *  (1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 3)
 *
 *  There are 13 possible ways to climb up a 5 step stair case
 *  (1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 1, 2),
 *  (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), (3, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2)
 *
 *
 *  Conditions:
 *      0 <= n <= 40  (Anything larger will take too long to calculate)
